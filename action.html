          <h1>Plastic Pellets are Small but Disastrous</h1>
          <img

          />
          <p>
            Like all plastics in our ocean, nurdles pose a great threat to
            marine life. These small round plastics usually float on the water's
            surface where many species feed. They're easily mistaken for fish
            eggs and other foods by seabirds, fish, sea turtles and many other
            ocean creatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            These small plastics are having a massively detrimental effect on
            the health of our ocean and its inhabitants. We need advocates, like
            you, to help push for policies and innovations that can help prevent
            plastics from reaching our ocean—and our beloved sea animals.

          <h1>Don't Let Congress Bulldoze Critical Ocean</h1>
          <img src="images/action2.png" alt="otter looking" class="round" />
          <p>
            Right now, members of Congress are looking to include dangerous
            anti-environment provisions in the fiscal year 2025 federal budget.
            These decision-makers—officials whom we elected to represent us—are
            prioritizing power over people and our planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            But together, we can stop them. Join Ocean's Voice and tell Congress
            to keep funding levels strong for agencies that protect and manage
            our ocean and coasts and keep poison-pill riders OUT of
            appropriation funding packages.

          <h1>Protect Whales and Protect the Ocean Now</h1>
          <img src="images/action3.png" alt="Personal Training" class="round" />
          <p>
            Critically endangered whales are under threat and we need your help
            to protect these charismatic creatures.
          </p>

          <p>
            As part of the ongoing budget negotiations, members of Congress have
            recently introduced harmful new measures aimed at dismantling
            critical protections for whales like the critically endangered North
            Atlantic right whale.
          </p>

          <p>
            Approximately 360 North Atlantic right whales remain on the planet,
            meaning there's a real danger we could lose this species forever if
            we don't act immediately.

          <h1>Steer The Shipping Industry in The Right Direction</h1>
          <p>
            Did you know that if ocean shipping were a country, it would be the
            sixth largest producer of climate pollution globally? That's right:
            The shipping industry belches out almost 1 billion tons of climate
            pollution each year.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ninety percent of the world's goods travel via ship, but many
            vessels rely on some of the dirtiest fuels to power their voyages,
            and the noxious emissions they release cause an estimated 250,000
            premature deaths and 6 million childhood asthma cases annually.
          </p>

          <p>
            As pollution from shipping continues to worsen, it's time to steer
            this industry in the right direction! Tell your member of Congress
            to hold the shipping industry accountable for its pollution by
            passing the International Maritime Pollution Accountability Act.
          </p>

          <p>
            We need to act fast. The climate crisis isn't slowing down, and we
            need bold action to protect our ocean from today's greatest threats.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tell Congress to pass the International Maritime Pollution
            Accountability Act now.
